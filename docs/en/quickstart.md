```

The script decompresses the data sample which the tests and examples in the project depend on.

please change the DATA_PATH,if you're using the full data coming from the recorders

```
# please change the path to your real store path
DATA_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'datasample'))

```


for how to use and extend the data, please refer to [data usage](./data_usage.md)

## run the main interface
```
python main.py
```
you could run zvt/main.py in pycharm directly

## run the strategies
[trader examples](https://github.com/zvtvz/zvt/tree/master/examples/trader)

set the factors for your trader,e.g,cross ma
```
class MyMaTrader(StockTrader):
    def init_selectors(self, entity_ids, entity_type, exchanges, codes, start_timestamp, end_timestamp):
        myselector = TargetSelector(entity_ids=entity_ids, entity_type=entity_type, exchanges=exchanges,
                                    codes=codes, start_timestamp=start_timestamp, end_timestamp=end_timestamp)

        myselector.add_filter_factor(
            CrossMaFactor(entity_ids=entity_ids, entity_type=entity_type, exchanges=exchanges,
                          codes=codes, start_timestamp=start_timestamp, end_timestamp=end_timestamp))

        self.selectors.append(myselector)

```

set the targets as many as you want
```
    # single stock with cross ma factor
    MyMaTrader(codes=['000338'], level=IntervalLevel.LEVEL_1DAY, start_timestamp='2018-01-01',
               end_timestamp='2019-06-30', trader_name='000338_ma_trader').run()
    
    # multiple stocks with bull factor
    MyBullTrader(codes=SAMPLE_STOCK_CODES, level=IntervalLevel.LEVEL_1DAY, start_timestamp='2018-01-01',
                 end_timestamp='2019-06-30', trader_name='sample_stocks_bull_trader').run()
```


open the running interface from the browser,check the results

The above is the market value curve of the strategy. The following is the k-line diagram of the targetS and trading signal mark, as well as the factor used in the strategy.

**<span style="color:#073785">You can see the factor and trading signals used in the strategy, so you can judge the accuracy and performance of the strategy very intuitively.</span>**
